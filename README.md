# Spark Lib - Flutter

This is a personal shared library for use with my Flutter projects. My goal for the library is to build into it all of the common application components I regularly use in any application project. Currently it contains a page-based navigator system built on top of Flutter's Navigator, the beginnings of custom implementations for the standard Material in-app notifications (i.e. Snackbar, Banner, Dialog), app initialization boilerplate, platform-independent filesystem locations (based on path_provider), custom desktop window titlebar and decorations (via Bitsdojo package), and a smattering of other more minor things. It is somewhat haphazard and I am actively developing it alongside application projects I work on.

If you're new to Dart, the lib directory contains all the code for the project. The library is split into folders based on categories. The test directory exists, but I have not written any unit tests yet.
